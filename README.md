## Time spent

- 3 days for programming 1 day for courses

## What was hard and easy in development

- ASP.NET Core MVC was easier for me than Angular, because I study ASP.NET development in University right now, but I haven't been 
programming Angular for 2 year now and it has changed a little bit.
- To me Angular is harder and showing data in the right place, but if I could recap Angular and learn a little bit then it is doable

## Development tools

- Angular, because I have used Angular before
- ASP.NET Core MVC, I study ASP.NET Core in University right now. In paper was written ASP.NET MVC, but because ASP.NET Core is newer
and has some extras I used ASP.NET Core MVC, also I have done this before.
